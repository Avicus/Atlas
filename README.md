# Atlas
Run Avicus games on any server.

This version of the code is the standalone release and requires no backend. 

While this version of the codebase is far easier to run than the full release, it does come with some drawbacks. These drawbacks include, but are not limited to:
* No persistence support (nothing is saved)
* No built-in tournament support
* No lobby support
* No punishment enforcement support

If you require any or all of these features, the backend-dependant version can be found [here](https://github.com/Avicus/AvicusNetwork).

**NOTE:** This will be the only version of the codebase that will receive any major updates going forward.
